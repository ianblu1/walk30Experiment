	%h3 How it works
	%p	
		You'll get a text message every day, serving as a reminder to walk 30 minutes.
		If the timing is right, just respond "yes" to the message. If it's not, respond
		"no", and we'll try again tomorrow. If you forget to respond, we may send you another
		text later in the evening to confirm whether you walked.

	%h3 What if I don't want to participate anymore?
	%p 	
		Easy! Just text "quit" to our message, and we won't bother you anymore. Or you can
		also 
		=link_to "contact us", contact_path
		and let us know you're done, and we'll remove you from the participant list.
		
	%h3 What's the ultimate goal?
	%p
		Well, ultimately we want you to get out aan walk! Healthy habits make a healthy life,
		so have fun!
